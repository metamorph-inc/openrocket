OpenRocket Simulation Example Scripts
=====================================
### Requirements
Simulating OpenRocket from Python scripts requires this [modified version of OpenRocket](https://github.com/metamorph-inc/openmeta-rocket/blob/master/openmeta-OpenRocket.jar) and the Python-Java bridge library called JPype.
Instructions for installing JPype can be found [here](https://github.com/metamorph-inc/openmeta-rocket/tree/master/JPype).

### orhelper.py
The OpenRocket helper library written by the original OpenRocket developers.

### simple.py
A simple example of loading an OpenRocket file and running a simulation.

### simple_plot.py
Example of getting time series data from a simulation and plotting it using the matplotlib library.

### monte_carlo.py & lazy.py
Advanced simulations - see [OpenRocket Wiki](http://wiki.openrocket.info/Scripting_with_Python_and_JPype) for descriptions.
